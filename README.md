## Agile Methodology

The plan for this project was carried out using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Pramilashanmugam/Restaurant/issues), were used to record the User Stories.  

Each User Story contains Acceptance Criteria and Tasks which I sometimes had to change after I did the process, as I wasn't yet sure what needed to be done to achieve the Acceptance Criteria I aimed for.

Since this was my first project using this methodology and the Django framework, some of the estimated story points were way off. In practice, a few of these tasks were completed faster than anticipated, while others took much longer. 

The [MoSCoW Method of Prioritisation](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework/moscow-prioririsation.html) was also used, classifying each User Story as a 'Must Have', 'Should Have' or 'Could Have'. Some "Won't Have's" didn't make it into the project and were left in the Backlog for a future iteration. It is important to note here, that by writing only enough User Stories to reach the Minimum Viable Product(MVP).
